📌 HandTalk AI — Bridging Communication Gaps with Sign Language AI
HandTalk AI is an AI-powered web application designed to bridge the communication gap between specially-abled individuals (specifically the deaf and hard-of-hearing community) and the wider society. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, HandTalk AI recognizes sign language gestures, converts them into text or speech, and vice versa — enabling seamless two-way interaction.

✅ Key Features
🔤 1. Sign-to-Text Translation
Uses real-time gesture recognition to detect sign language hand gestures.
Converts recognized gestures into readable text on the screen.
Helps hearing individuals understand what a signer is communicating.

🗣️ 2. Text-to-Sign & Speech-to-Sign
Converts typed text or spoken words into corresponding sign language animations or images.
Allows people who don’t know sign language to communicate back to the signer effectively.

💬 3. Speech-to-Text
Captures spoken input from a microphone.
Converts it instantly into text for users with hearing impairments.

🧠 How It Works
Computer Vision Models: Detect hand landmarks using models like MediaPipe or TensorFlow.
Machine Learning Classifier: Classifies detected hand poses into corresponding alphabets, words, or phrases.
Natural Language Processing: Handles text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions for enhanced accessibility.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with a responsive and intuitive front-end for easy interaction.

🎯 Objective
HandTalk AI’s primary goal is to empower individuals with hearing or speech impairments by providing an AI-driven
tool that translates between sign language and text or speech. 
It promotes inclusion and equal opportunities in communication, education, and daily life.
