📌 HandTalk AI — Bridging Communication Gaps with Sign Language AI
HandTalk AI is an AI-powered web application designed to bridge the communication gap between specially-abled individuals
(specifically the deaf and hard-of-hearing community) and the wider society. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, 
HandTalk AI recognizes sign language gestures, converts them into text or speech, and vice versa — enabling seamless two-way interaction.

✅ Key Features<br>
🔤 1. Sign-to-Text Translation<br>
Uses real-time gesture recognition to detect sign language hand gestures.<br>
Converts recognized gestures into readable text on the screen.<br>
Helps hearing individuals understand what a signer is communicating.<br>

🗣️ 2. Text-to-Sign & Speech-to-Sign<br>
Converts typed text or spoken words into corresponding sign language animations or images.<br>
Allows people who don’t know sign language to communicate back to the signer effectively.<br>

💬 3. Speech-to-Text<br>
Captures spoken input from a microphone.<br>
Converts it instantly into text for users with hearing impairments.<br>

🧠 How It Works<br>
Computer Vision Models: Detect hand landmarks using models like MediaPipe or TensorFlow.<br>
Machine Learning Classifier: Classifies detected hand poses into corresponding alphabets, words, or phrases.<br>
Natural Language Processing: Handles text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions for enhanced accessibility.<br>
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with a responsive and intuitive front-end for easy interaction.<br>

🎯 Objective<br>
HandTalk AI’s primary goal is to empower individuals with hearing or speech impairments by providing an AI-driven<br>
tool that translates between sign language and text or speech. <br>
It promotes inclusion and equal opportunities in communication, education, and daily life.<br>

❤️ Impact<br>
HandTalk AI contributes towards making digital communication more inclusive and accessible for millions of<br>
people globally who rely on sign language, empowering them to interact independently in both personal and professional contexts.<br>
